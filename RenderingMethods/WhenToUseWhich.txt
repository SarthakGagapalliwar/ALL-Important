|  Where rendering happens?       | Browser (client)                                  | Server (on every request)                                           | Build time (before deployment)                             | Build time + re-generated on demand                                                  |
|  First Load Speed               | ❌ Slow (white screen until JS loads)              | ✅ Fast (HTML ready)                                                 | ✅ Super fast (CDN static files)                            | ✅ Super fast (CDN + updated in background)                                           |
|  Navigation (after first load)  | ✅ Instant (SPA-like)                              | ❌ Needs server request                                              | ✅ Instant (static files)                                   | ✅ Instant (static files)                                                             |
|  SEO                            | ❌ Poor (needs extra setup)                        | ✅ Great (HTML rendered)                                             | ✅ Excellent                                                | ✅ Excellent                                                                          |
|  Best For                       | Highly interactive SPAs (dashboards, chats, etc.) | Dynamic content that changes per request (news feed, user profiles) | Content that rarely changes (blogs, docs, marketing sites) | Content that changes occasionally (e-commerce products, blogs with frequent updates) |
|  Server Load                    | ✅ Low (server only serves static files)           | ❌ High (render on each request)                                     | ✅ Very low (just static files)                             | ✅ Low (regenerates only when needed)                                                 |

|  Freshness of Data              | ✅ Always fresh (from APIs)                        | ✅ Always fresh (from server)                                        | ❌ Can be outdated until rebuild                            | ⚡ Fresh after revalidation interval                                                  |

👉 Quick use cases:

CSR: Dashboards, Gmail-like apps, chats, where SEO isn’t a priority.
SSR: News sites, dynamic content apps, logged-in user-specific data.
SSG: Blogs, documentation, portfolios, marketing pages.
ISR: E-commerce stores, large blogs, sites with frequently updated but not real-time data.



🧠 Memory Tricks

CSR (Client-Side Rendering):
👉 “Browser builds the page.”
First load is slow, but navigation is super fast.
Best for SPAs like Gmail, dashboards, chats.

SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
👉 “Server builds the page on every request.”
Fast first load, good for SEO, but heavier on the server.
Best for dynamic sites (news, user profiles).

SSG (Static Site Generation):
👉 “Page built once, served forever.”
Blazing fast, SEO-friendly, but not good for frequently changing data.
Best for blogs, docs, portfolios.

ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
👉 “Static, but can refresh in the background.”
Combines speed of SSG with freshness of SSR.
Best for e-commerce, large blogs, frequently updated content.

⚡ Quick formula to remember:

CSR → Client does work
User -> Request page
Server -> Sends EMPTY HTML + JS bundle
Browser -> Runs JS -> Fetches Data -> Renders UI

SSR → Server does work
User -> Request page
Server -> Fetches Data + Renders HTML
Server -> Sends FULL HTML to Browser
Browser -> Shows content immediately

SSG → Build does work
Build Time -> Pages pre-rendered into HTML
User -> Request page
Server/CDN -> Sends READY HTML instantly


ISR → Build + refresh on demand
Build Time -> Pages pre-rendered
User -> Request page
CDN -> Serves static HTML
Revalidation Time -> Server regenerates page in background
Next User -> Gets fresh HTML
